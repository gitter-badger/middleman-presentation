<a name="chunky_png"></a>
### <a href="http://wiki.github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png">chunky_png</a> v1.3.1
#### Pure ruby library for read/write, chunk-level access to PNG files

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

    This pure Ruby library can read and write PNG images without depending on an external 
    image library, like RMagick. It tries to be memory efficient and reasonably fast.
    
    It supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the specification, 
    with one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It supports all transparency, 
    interlacing and filtering options the PNG specifications allows. It can also read and 
    write textual metadata from PNG files. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks is
    also possible.
    
    This library supports simple drawing on the image canvas and simple operations like
    alpha composition and cropping. Finally, it can import from and export to RMagick for 
    interoperability.
    
    Also, have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png. OilyPNG is a 
    drop in mixin module that implements some of the ChunkyPNG algorithms in C, which 
    provides a massive speed boost to encoding and decoding.

EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network
communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all
interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

<a name="minitest"></a>
### <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">minitest</a> v5.4.0
#### minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

    "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
     allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

    -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest"

minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
extract-method refactorings still apply.

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

<a name="rake"></a>
### <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rake">rake</a> v10.3.2
#### Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
  tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)

* Supports parallel execution of tasks.

#### Better Sass integration with Sprockets 2.0

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

When using Sprockets 2.0 with Sass you will eventually run into a pretty big issue. `//= require` directives will not allow Sass mixins, variables, etc. to be shared between files. So you'll try to use `@import`, and that'll also blow up in your face. `sprockets-sass` fixes all of this by creating a Sass::Importer that is Sprockets aware.
