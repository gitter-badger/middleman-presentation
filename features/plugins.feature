Feature: Use plugins to add features

  As a presentator
  I want to create my own plugins
  In order to add new features middleman-presentation

  #  @wip
  #  Scenario: List available plugins
  #    Given I successfully run `middleman-presentation create presentation1 --title "My Presentation"`
  #    And I cd to "presentation1"
  #    And I installed plugin "test-simple"
  #    When I successfully run `bundle exec middleman-presentation show plugins`
  #    Then the output should contain:
  #    """
  #    test-simple
  #    """
  #
